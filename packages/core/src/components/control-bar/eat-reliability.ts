/**
 * The EAT reliability filter's user-facing model, and its translation to and from
 * query conditions.
 *
 * ## Why every mode carries an N/A chip
 *
 * Curated proteins have no prediction, so they carry `null` in the eat-confidence
 * column and no comparison can match them. The presence chip is what keeps them
 * visible: `>= X` with `[NA_VALUE]` reads "reliable enough, **or** not an EAT
 * prediction at all". Every mode therefore states its intent directly, as one
 * un-negated condition:
 *
 *   at least X    ->  confidence >= X   or N/A
 *   at most  X    ->  confidence <= X   or N/A
 *   between A,B   ->  confidence between A and B (inclusive), or N/A
 *
 * The predecessor spelled the first of these `NOT(confidence < X)`, which worked
 * only because `NOT` was a bare index complement that happened to sweep nulls back
 * in. `NOT` now means "has a value AND does not match", so the negated form would
 * hide curated points instead — the exact opposite of what the control promises.
 */

/**
 * The operator each mode states itself with. `Record` over the mode union, so a fourth
 * mode is a compile error here rather than a silently unfiltered query — and pairing it
 * with `numericFieldsFor` means the bounds a condition carries are decided by the
 * operator that will read them, not by a second hand-written mode table.

 * a fresh id on every commit makes the row fall back to the global count and discards
 * a half-typed bound while the user is still typing it.

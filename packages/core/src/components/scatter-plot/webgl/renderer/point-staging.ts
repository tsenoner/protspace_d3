 * which are invisible but kept so the sort order is stable across visibility
 * toggles), sorts indices far->near via {@link sortIndicesByDepthDescending}
 * (descending depth, ties broken by ascending original slot index), and derives
 * the two-pass selection cut (`selectedStartIndex`) from the FIRST sorted slot
 * whose opacity is >= 0.99 when a selection is active.
 *
 * Extracting it here makes export == live structural rather than

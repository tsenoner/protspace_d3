/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 *
 * The camera path: what `_getPointsForRendering` hands the renderer, and whether
 * it is the same object from one frame to the next.
 *
 * That identity is the whole fix for #456. The renderer's dirty gate compares
 * content signatures, so a *new* PlotData whose length differs — which is exactly
 * what a viewport cull produces as points enter and leave — trips a full
 * re-stage: an O(N log N) depth sort, ~8 style-getter calls per point, and
 * ~44 MB of buffer uploads. Measured at 1,000,000 points that turned a 1.0 ms
 * zoom into 888 ms and a 1.0 ms pan into 120 ms.
 *
 * The gate reads `_plotData.length` and nothing else, so these tests install a
 * `{ length }` fake rather than allocating a million-element array. They run in
 * milliseconds and fail on the pre-fix tree for the right reason: at 1.5M the old
 * code took the cull branch and returned a freshly materialised object.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Reserved EAT companions are normalized into a side-channel

The loader SHALL recognize exact `BASE__pred_value`, `BASE__pred_confidence`, and
`BASE__pred_source` companion columns, exclude reserved companions from ordinary annotations, and
expose valid transferred cells through `annotation_predicted[BASE]` in protein order. A transferred
cell SHALL contain a non-empty value and source plus a finite confidence in `[0,1]`, and SHALL exist
only when the curated base cell is missing. Multi-valued transferred cells SHALL preserve ordered
decoded labels and positionally aligned score/evidence metadata. Prediction source ids SHALL be
encoded and decoded as one opaque v2 field rather than categorical hit grammar.

#### Scenario: Valid transfer triple

- **WHEN** a protein has a missing `ec` cell and valid values in all three `ec__pred_*` companions
- **THEN** `annotation_predicted.ec` contains the value, confidence, and source at that protein index
- **AND** none of the three companion names appears in ordinary annotations

#### Scenario: Curated value takes precedence

- **WHEN** a protein has both a curated base value and populated companion values
- **THEN** the base value remains curated and the prediction side-channel is null for that cell

#### Scenario: Invalid or incomplete prediction

- **WHEN** a companion triple is incomplete, blank, non-finite, or outside the confidence range
- **THEN** the loader does not create a partial transferred cell
- **AND** it reports the affected column without failing the otherwise valid bundle

#### Scenario: Bundle without EAT companions

- **WHEN** a legacy bundle contains no recognized companion columns
- **THEN** it produces no prediction side-channel and all existing annotation behavior is unchanged

#### Scenario: Opaque reserved-character source id

- **WHEN** the transfer source identifier contains literal `%`, `;`, or `|` characters
- **THEN** CLI output encodes it as one v2 field and web normalization restores the exact identifier
- **AND** provenance resolution matches that exact identifier to its projected source protein

#### Scenario: Legacy v1 transfer migration

- **WHEN** transfer operates on a v1 bundle containing literal `%XX`, pipe suffixes, or semicolons
  inside parenthesized categorical labels
- **THEN** the replacement annotations table is structurally migrated before it is stamped v2
- **AND** curated and transferred hit labels, scores, and evidence have the same parsed structure
  before and after the transfer boundary

### Requirement: Confidence is exposed through a deliberate numeric annotation

For every normalized EAT base column, the system SHALL expose one synthetic selectable numeric
annotation labelled “<base label> — EAT confidence.” Its values SHALL be the raw reliability indices
for transferred cells and null for all other proteins. Raw confidence companion names and synthetic
storage keys SHALL NOT be serialized as ordinary annotations. Generated confidence annotations
SHALL carry explicit runtime identity; suffix spelling alone SHALL NOT classify a user annotation as
synthetic. When the preferred generated key collides, the loader SHALL allocate a distinct internal
key and preserve both annotations.

#### Scenario: Selecting EAT confidence

- **WHEN** a user selects the synthetic confidence annotation for `ec`
- **THEN** the existing numeric gradient path renders raw reliability-index values for transferred
  proteins and N/A for other proteins
- **AND** markers are filled numeric markers rather than EAT hollow categorical markers

#### Scenario: Selected confidence retains runtime identity

- **WHEN** the generated confidence annotation is selected and numeric bins are materialized for
  display
- **THEN** the materialized annotation retains its explicit EAT-confidence runtime role and base
  annotation identity
- **AND** exporting that selected view omits the generated key from wire annotations

#### Scenario: Confidence label and explanation

- **WHEN** the synthetic confidence annotation is displayed in the selector or legend
- **THEN** it has an EAT-specific friendly label and explains that the value is a reliability index,
  not a calibrated probability

#### Scenario: Filter by raw reliability index

- **WHEN** a user selects the generated confidence annotation in the existing filter builder and
  configures a numeric comparison
- **THEN** filtering evaluates the raw reliability indices rather than materialized display bins
- **AND** proteins without a transferred value do not match a positive reliability comparison

#### Scenario: User annotation shares the preferred synthetic suffix

- **WHEN** an EAT or non-EAT v1/v2 bundle contains a real numeric or categorical annotation named
  `BASE__eat_confidence`
- **THEN** that user annotation remains ordinary data and round-trips without loss
- **AND** an EAT base uses a separately identified runtime annotation rather than overwriting or
  suppressing the user column

### Requirement: EAT overlay controls are conditional, accessible, and persisted

For datasets with normalized EAT cells, the annotation selector SHALL mark every base annotation
that has transferred values. When one of those bases is selected, the transferred-annotation legend
SHALL provide an EAT overlay switch and native range plus numeric percentage threshold controls
beside the observed/transferred population key. The range and numeric controls SHALL represent one
value and remain synchronized. The accessible group SHALL default to overlay enabled and threshold
`0` — every prediction shown and the filter box clean — and its threshold SHALL mirror two-way with
the shared `NOT(EAT_confidence < x)` query filter. The complete control SHALL be absent when the
selected annotation has no usable EAT cells, including confidence-view and non-EAT selections.
Optional `eatOverlayEnabled` and `eatConfidenceThreshold` bundle settings SHALL validate, normalize,
write even when they are the only settings, and on dataset load seed the slider (which derives the
filter condition only above `0`).

#### Scenario: EAT-capable dataset

- **WHEN** a dataset with normalized EAT cells loads without embedded EAT settings
- **THEN** the switch is enabled and on, the threshold is `0%`, and both controls have accessible
  names and keyboard behavior
- **AND** the controls are contained by an accessible EAT-labelled group
- **AND** the group is rendered inside the transferred-annotation legend section

#### Scenario: EAT annotations are discoverable

- **WHEN** the annotation selector opens for a dataset containing transfers for `ec` and
  `protein_families`
- **THEN** both base rows expose a text-labelled EAT marker to sighted and assistive-technology
  users
- **AND** ordinary annotations and generated confidence views do not receive that marker

#### Scenario: Range and percentage entry stay synchronized

- **WHEN** the user changes either the threshold slider or the bounded `0` to `100` percentage
  input
- **THEN** the other control reflects the same normalized threshold
- **AND** one `eat-overlay-change` contract drives the shared reliability query filter

#### Scenario: Selected annotation has no transfers

- **WHEN** an EAT-capable dataset selects a base without transferred cells or a generated
  confidence view
- **THEN** the complete EAT control group is absent without leaving responsive-grid spacing

#### Scenario: Constrained view temporarily has no transferred rows

- **WHEN** filtering or isolation reduces an EAT-capable dataset to a population with no predicted
  rows
- **THEN** capable annotation markers and selected-base EAT controls remain available from the
  stable loaded dataset
- **AND** population counts and rendering still reflect only the constrained view

#### Scenario: Dataset without EAT

- **WHEN** a dataset without normalized EAT cells loads
- **THEN** the complete EAT control group is absent from the rendered DOM and accessibility tree
- **AND** no empty group spacing or orphaned EAT label remains

#### Scenario: Embedded settings omit the optional threshold

- **WHEN** bundle settings are present but omit `eatConfidenceThreshold`
- **THEN** restore uses `DEFAULT_EAT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` rather than a separate literal fallback

#### Scenario: Embedded settings round-trip

- **WHEN** a bundle is exported with overlay disabled and threshold `0.75`, then reloaded
- **THEN** the overlay is restored disabled and the reliability slider seeds `0.75`, deriving its
  `NOT(EAT_confidence < 0.75)` query filter

#### Scenario: Embedded settings restore from OPFS

- **WHEN** a persisted bundle with overlay disabled and threshold `0.75` is replayed from OPFS
- **THEN** its normalized embedded EAT settings override dataset-reset defaults in both the reliability
  slider and its shared query filter
- **AND** settings absent from the bundle retain the enabled and `0` defaults

#### Scenario: Invalid optional setting

- **WHEN** an otherwise valid settings object contains a non-boolean overlay flag or a threshold
  outside `[0,1]`
- **THEN** normalization drops the invalid optional value and retains the valid settings object

### Requirement: Overlay coalesces categories without mutating curated data

When the overlay is enabled and an EAT base annotation is active, the effective category SHALL be
the curated value when present and otherwise the transferred value. Observed cells SHALL remain
filled. Transferred cells SHALL use the same category mapping but render as hollow, anti-aliased
markers with a clearly legible, bounded outline that remains responsive to point size while
preserving a visible hollow interior. The interior SHALL use an opaque plot-surface knockout so
overlapping observed or transferred markers cannot fill the hollow cue by showing through it.
Multi-valued transferred cells SHALL retain every decoded label and use the existing multi-label
marker segmentation. Disabling the overlay SHALL return transferred cells to their curated missing
category.

#### Scenario: Observed and transferred category share a hue

- **WHEN** an observed protein and a transferred protein have the same effective category
- **THEN** both use the same legend category color while the observed marker is filled and the
  transferred marker is hollow

#### Scenario: Prediction-only category

- **WHEN** a transferred value is absent from all curated cells
- **THEN** the enabled overlay includes it in the effective legend and assigns it a stable category
  encoding without reordering existing observed categories

#### Scenario: Multi-valued transferred category

- **WHEN** a transferred companion cell contains two structural semicolon-separated labels
- **THEN** overlay materialization assigns both category indices to that protein
- **AND** live and exported markers use the existing multi-label segmentation with both hues

#### Scenario: Sparse multi-hit prediction at target scale

- **WHEN** a 500,000 to 1,000,000-row single-valued base has only a small number of multi-valued
  transferred cells
- **THEN** overlay materialization retains compact single-value storage and stores only those
  exceptional rows as multi-value overrides
- **AND** retained multi-value allocation grows with exceptional rows rather than total proteins

#### Scenario: Sparse multi-hit prediction disables incompatible shape selection

- **WHEN** overlay materialization stores a transferred protein with multiple category indices in a
  sparse override
- **THEN** the legend classifies the selected annotation as multi-label
- **AND** shape selection remains unavailable exactly as it does for dense multi-label annotations
- **AND** classification work scales with sparse overrides rather than total proteins

#### Scenario: Hollow outline remains legible across point sizes

- **WHEN** a user increases or decreases legend point size
- **THEN** the hollow transferred outline remains visibly thicker than the anti-alias fringe
- **AND** a visible hollow interior remains at the minimum, default, and maximum supported sizes
- **AND** its responsive thickness is bounded rather than required to scale linearly with marker
  diameter, with identical live and exported rendering

#### Scenario: Hollow cue survives overlapping markers

- **WHEN** a transferred marker is painted over one or more observed or transferred markers
- **THEN** its opaque plot-surface interior masks the earlier marker pixels
- **AND** the final composited live and exported marker remains visibly hollow
- **AND** the canonical painter order places transferred markers after ordinary markers within the
  same interaction tier while preserving selected points as the top tier
- **AND** transparent export keeps non-marker pixels transparent while retaining the live
  plot-surface colour inside transferred markers

#### Scenario: Overlay disabled

- **WHEN** the user disables the overlay
- **THEN** transferred proteins use their curated missing value and no point is flagged hollow by EAT

#### Scenario: Grayscale and image export

- **WHEN** the current view is rendered live, composited in grayscale, or exported to PNG
- **THEN** observed-versus-transferred distinction remains encoded by filled-versus-hollow geometry

### Requirement: Reliability threshold filters sub-threshold predictions

The reliability threshold SHALL hide predictions whose transferred confidence is below its position
by driving a shared `NOT(EAT_confidence < x)` query-filter condition, not by dimming points.
Transferred predictions render at full opacity while visible. Curated (non-transferred) points, which
carry no confidence, SHALL always remain visible regardless of the threshold. At position `0` the
threshold SHALL create no condition, so every point is shown and the filter box stays clean. The
slider and the query filter SHALL mirror two-way: moving the slider upserts or removes the condition,
editing that condition moves the slider, and each direction guards on the threshold value so they do
not oscillate. Existing hidden, selected, highlighted, and selection-fade precedence SHALL remain
consistent for the points that stay visible.

#### Scenario: Default shows every prediction

- **WHEN** the reliability threshold is at its default position `0`
- **THEN** no reliability condition exists and every transferred and curated point is visible

#### Scenario: Sub-threshold predictions are filtered out

- **WHEN** the threshold is raised above `0`
- **THEN** a `NOT(EAT_confidence < x)` condition is applied and predictions with confidence below `x`
  are removed from the visible set
- **AND** curated points, which have no confidence, remain visible

#### Scenario: Slider and filter mirror two-way

- **WHEN** the user moves the slider or edits the equivalent `NOT(EAT_confidence < x)` condition in
  the filter builder
- **THEN** the other control reflects the same normalized threshold without oscillating

#### Scenario: Hidden category wins

- **WHEN** a transferred point's effective category is hidden in the legend
- **THEN** its opacity and interactivity are exactly zero regardless of confidence or highlight

#### Scenario: Connector highlight wins

- **WHEN** a transferred point is highlighted as a connector endpoint
- **THEN** it receives selected opacity while retaining hollow geometry

#### Scenario: Opacity-tier membership invalidation

- **WHEN** `baseOpacity`, `selectedOpacity`, or `fadedOpacity` is configured at zero and selection
  or highlight changes which opacity tier applies to a point
- **THEN** cached interactable membership is recomputed and reflects the new zero/non-zero state
- **AND** when all tiers are positive, highlight-only changes reuse the default membership cache

### Requirement: Tooltip communicates per-cell EAT provenance

For an active EAT base annotation with the overlay enabled, a transferred protein tooltip SHALL show
the transferred value, confidence as a percentage, source protein id, and a compact confidence bar.
The content SHALL identify the cell as “Predicted (transferred)” and SHALL remain separate from the
column-level model-prediction badge.

#### Scenario: Transferred protein tooltip

- **WHEN** the user hovers a transferred protein while its base annotation is active
- **THEN** the tooltip shows every transferred label, “Predicted (transferred),” bounded confidence,
  source id, and confidence bar
- **AND** every transferred label remains fully readable without single-line truncation

#### Scenario: Observed protein tooltip

- **WHEN** the user hovers an observed protein
- **THEN** no per-cell EAT provenance block is shown for that annotation

### Requirement: Legend accounts for observed and transferred populations

For an active EAT base annotation with the overlay enabled, the legend SHALL render a distinct
“Predicted (transferred)” section with filled “Observed” and hollow “Predicted by EAT” rows with
live counts from the current filtered/isolation view. Proteins whose only value is the NA category
are already represented by the dataset's existing N/A legend entry and SHALL NOT be duplicated in
this section. This section SHALL not replace or reuse the column-level predicted badge.

#### Scenario: Full dataset counts

- **WHEN** an EAT base annotation is active in the full dataset
- **THEN** the legend reports observed and transferred counts for that annotation view

#### Scenario: Constrained-view counts

- **WHEN** filtering or isolation changes the visible protein set
- **THEN** the observed and transferred counts update to the constrained view

#### Scenario: Non-EAT or disabled view

- **WHEN** the active annotation has no prediction channel
- **THEN** the complete EAT legend control and population section are absent
- **WHEN** the active EAT overlay is disabled
- **THEN** the population rows are absent but the EAT control remains available so the user can
  re-enable the overlay

### Requirement: EAT data survives slicing, hashing, and bundle round-trip

Prediction cells SHALL remain aligned when visualization data is sliced and SHALL retain both their
lossless storage value and decoded display-label list. Dataset fingerprints SHALL change when any
prediction label, confidence, or source changes. Bundle export SHALL reconstruct the curated base
cells and all three backend companion columns, even when called with an overlay-materialized view,
and SHALL omit synthetic confidence annotations.

#### Scenario: Slice alignment

- **WHEN** proteins are filtered or isolated into a reordered subset
- **THEN** each remaining protein retains its own prediction value, confidence, and source

#### Scenario: Prediction-sensitive hash

- **WHEN** two datasets have identical protein ids and curated annotations but different EAT source
  or confidence data
- **THEN** they produce different dataset hashes

#### Scenario: Target-scale cache fingerprinting

- **WHEN** a 500,000 to 1,000,000-row dataset contains EAT predictions and generated raw confidence
  data
- **THEN** dataset hashing reuses one stable protein-index order across those tracks
- **AND** it does not allocate or sort a full row-object array per prediction or numeric track

#### Scenario: Lossless round-trip from enabled overlay

- **WHEN** an EAT bundle is loaded, displayed with the overlay enabled, exported, and loaded again
- **THEN** curated base cells remain missing where originally missing
- **AND** every valid prediction value, confidence, and source is preserved in its companion column
- **AND** no synthetic confidence column is written

#### Scenario: Golden v2 structural round-trip

- **WHEN** a backend-produced v2 bundle containing EAT cells, literal structural characters in
  labels, evidence suffixes, score suffixes, and multi-hit categorical cells is exported and loaded
  again
- **THEN** the annotations parquet remains stamped `protspace_format_version=2`
- **AND** every protein retains the same annotation set, evidence, and score companions
- **AND** every EAT value, confidence, and source companion is preserved

#### Scenario: Multi-valued EAT companion round-trip

- **WHEN** a v1 or v2 EAT value companion contains multiple decoded labels, including a label with
  a literal structural character
- **THEN** the runtime cell retains the exact ordered label list for display
- **AND** export writes each label with v2 escaping and structural separators
- **AND** reload reconstructs the same ordered labels rather than one semicolon-containing category

#### Scenario: Collision-safe v1 and v2 round-trip

- **WHEN** v1 or v2 data contains a legitimate annotation ending in `__eat_confidence`, with or
  without EAT companions for its base
- **THEN** export and reload preserve every user annotation value
- **AND** only explicitly generated runtime confidence annotations are omitted from storage

#### Scenario: Selected-confidence export and reload

- **WHEN** an EAT bundle selects its generated confidence annotation, exports the resulting
  materialized visualization data, and reloads it
- **THEN** no generated confidence key is present in the annotations wire table
- **AND** reload reconstructs exactly one generated confidence annotation with the same explicit
  role and base identity
- **AND** every EAT value, confidence, and source companion remains unchanged

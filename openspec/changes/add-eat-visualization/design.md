## Context

The merged `protspace transfer` backend writes three inline companion columns for each transferred
annotation `COL`: `COL__pred_value`, `COL__pred_confidence`, and `COL__pred_source`. Query and
reference proteins already share every projection; transfer operates in the original embedding
space and never changes coordinates. The frontend currently treats all annotation-table columns as
ordinary color-by inputs, so the companions leak into selection and a transferred value has no
visual distinction from curated data.

This implementation must preserve several newer frontend invariants that post-date the issue's
concrete hooks: point opacity is centralized in `visibility-model.ts`, numeric annotations are
materialized on demand, filtered/isolation views retain global protein indices, and live WebGL and
off-screen export share one staging and shader pipeline. The application must also round-trip the
backend representation without converting display-time coalesced values into curated values.

The approved backend design, issues #277 and #300, the supplied real phosphatase bundle, and the
interactive PoC are the behavioral inputs. No external runtime dependency is needed.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- Normalize EAT companions into one typed, per-protein source of truth and hide their storage names.
- Make observed and transferred values simultaneously legible, including in grayscale and exports.
- Keep confidence interpretable as the backend's reliability index rather than presenting it as a
  calibrated probability.
- Expose bidirectional provenance without degrading interaction on large datasets or high fan-out
  sources.
- Preserve old bundles, filtering/isolation semantics, settings, and lossless bundle round-trips.
- Cover numerical boundaries, rendering/staging, accessibility, real-bundle loading, and interactive
  behavior with deterministic tests.

**Non-Goals:**

- Changing EAT inference, nearest-neighbor search, metric, `k`, calibration, or backend output.
- Adding out-of-sample projection, multi-source transfer, persisted metric metadata, or a new bundle
  part/version.
- Changing the existing column-level predicted-annotation metadata badge.
- Exporting transient provenance connector lines into publication figures; hollow marker semantics
  are exported, while connectors remain an exploratory interaction overlay.

## Decisions

### D1. Normalize exact companion triples at the conversion boundary

Add `PredictedCell = { value: string; confidence: number; source: string }` and optional
`VisualizationData.annotation_predicted`, keyed by the base annotation and indexed by global protein
position. Conversion recognizes only exact `BASE__pred_(value|confidence|source)` suffixes, excludes
every recognized reserved companion from ordinary annotations, and creates a cell only when:

- the base cell is missing after standard missing-value normalization;
- value and source are non-empty strings; and
- confidence is finite and inside `[0, 1]`.

Incomplete schemas and invalid rows are ignored as predictions and reported once per column, rather
than partially displaying scientifically ambiguous records. Companion values on a curated base cell
are ignored. Old bundles produce no channel and retain current behavior.

Alternatives considered: keeping raw companions selectable was rejected because source ids are
high-cardinality provenance, not categories; parsing independently at each render site was rejected
because it would permit inconsistent validity and missing-value rules.

### D2. Provide a deliberate synthetic confidence annotation and a display-only overlay

For every normalized base column, conversion adds a numeric runtime annotation with values
`confidence | null`. It prefers the `BASE__eat_confidence` key, but allocates a distinct internal key
when that name already belongs to a user annotation. The generated `Annotation` carries explicit
runtime metadata identifying its EAT-confidence role and base annotation; serialization and display
metadata use that identity instead of suffix spelling. A real numeric or categorical column ending
in `__eat_confidence` remains an ordinary annotation and round-trips unchanged. Synthetic keys are
selectable but only explicitly marked generated entries are omitted from bundle output. Numeric
display materialization merges its derived bins into the source annotation rather than replacing
the source object, so runtime identity survives selection, `getCurrentData()`, and export.

Base categorical metadata includes the stable union of observed categories followed by any
prediction-only categories. Raw `annotation_data` remains curated. When the overlay is enabled and a
base EAT column is selected, scatter-plot materialization clones only that selected column's index
storage and replaces missing slots with predicted category indices. A compact single-valued base
remains an `Int32Array`; uncommon multi-hit predictions are stored as sparse row overrides rather
than boxing every protein into a child array. The result is cached by data, annotation, overlay
state, and numeric settings. Shared annotation-data guards classify multi-label capability across
typed, dense, and sparse storage; sparse classification scans only exceptional overrides so legend
shape gating does not regress to an all-row walk. The legend and styling consume this materialized
view; disabling the overlay immediately returns to curated indices.

Alternatives considered: mutating base annotation rows during conversion was rejected because the
off state and lossless export need the curated representation; teaching every consumer to coalesce
independently was rejected because it would fork legend, tooltip, visibility, and filter semantics.
Rejecting an otherwise valid EAT bundle solely because a user chose the preferred synthetic name
was also rejected; collision-safe allocation preserves both meanings without data loss.

### D3. Extend the authoritative visibility model for confidence

The visibility model receives overlay state and threshold and remains the only opacity authority.
Observed cells retain existing opacity tiers. A non-selected transferred cell uses
`lerp(0.25, 0.9, confidence)`; below the threshold, that alpha is multiplied by `0.35` with a
non-zero floor, so it fades but never disappears. Hidden categories still produce exactly zero,
and selection/highlight still wins with selected opacity. The model's memo keys include all new
inputs, preserving hidden-mask reuse and deterministic hit testing.

Confidence is displayed as a percentage but described as a reliability index/ranking. The UI does
not call it probability or accuracy.

Threshold input changes invalidate only visibility/style caches and redraw GPU alpha. Because the
contract keeps below-threshold points non-zero and interactive, threshold changes do not rebuild
plot geometry or the quadtree and do not emit the population-bearing `data-change` event consumed
by the legend.

Interactable-membership caching keys selection and highlight identities whenever any supported
observed opacity tier (`baseOpacity`, `selectedOpacity`, or `fadedOpacity`) is non-interactive
(`<= 0`). If every tier is positive, selection and highlight can only restyle points and the
default connector-highlight fast path reuses membership. EAT confidence opacity has a positive
floor, while selected EAT endpoints still follow the same selected-opacity tier.

Alternative considered: applying confidence in `style-getters.ts` was rejected because WebGL hit
testing, visible counts, depth ordering, and exports now share the visibility model by design.

### D4. Carry an explicit predicted flag through shared WebGL staging

Add `isPredicted(point)` to style getters and one float `a_predicted` attribute to the shared point
layout, staging arrays, live buffers, export buffers, and shaders. The fragment shader reuses the
existing signed-distance field: observed markers retain the filled shape, while transferred markers
discard the interior and retain an anti-aliased outline of the same category color. The flag is
active only for the selected base annotation while the overlay is enabled; the synthetic confidence
view remains a conventional filled numeric gradient.

One shared shader source continues to drive live, grayscale-composited, and PNG paths. A dedicated
attribute is preferred over overloading shape or alpha because those channels already encode
independent category and visibility semantics.

### D5. Treat EAT display settings as global bundle state

Add optional `eatOverlayEnabled` and `eatConfidenceThreshold` fields to `BundleSettings`. Defaults
are enabled and `0.50` when a dataset has predictions. Validation accepts only a boolean and a finite
number in `[0,1]`; normalization drops invalid optional values while retaining otherwise valid
settings. The writer gate recognizes EAT-only settings.

The transferred-annotation legend exposes an EAT switch and synchronized native range plus numeric
percentage input (`0..1`, step `0.01`) when the selected annotation has normalized EAT cells in the
stable loaded dataset. Keeping the control beside the filled/hollow population key makes the
setting part of the encoding it changes and removes the wide fieldset and its responsive rules from
the global control bar. A non-EAT selection omits the complete control so it contributes no
irrelevant focus targets or accessibility-tree content. The threshold inputs are disabled while
the overlay is off. Legend auto-sync updates scatter state directly and emits one bubbling
`eat-overlay-change` contract. Loading embedded settings applies to the plot before legend sync;
parquet export writes the current plot values.

Embedded EAT settings have the same precedence for direct imports and OPFS replay: normalized bundle
values are applied after dataset-reset defaults, and absent fields fall back to enabled and `0.50`.
EAT state has no separate per-dataset browser persistence channel, so
OPFS MUST replay the embedded values rather than silently retaining reset defaults.

### D6. Keep provenance pairs as ids in a dedicated SVG controller

A `ConnectorOverlayController`, peer to the duplicate-stack controller, stores id pairs plus summary
metadata. At render time it builds a current plot id-to-slot map, resolves plane-mapped `_plotData`
coordinates through current scales, and draws dashed, round-capped, non-scaling SVG lines in a
`connector-lines-layer` child of the already transformed overlay group. Pan/zoom therefore needs no
recomputation; data, projection, plane, scale, filter, and isolation changes rerender endpoints.
Ordinary dismissal clears request/geometry while retaining the current-view index for reuse. Dataset
replacement uses a distinct cache invalidation operation that releases both the indexed `PlotData`
reference and its id-to-slot map, preventing the prior million-row view from being retained when no
new connector is created. Every overlay render observes current `PlotData` identity before its
inactive-request fast return: an exact identity match retains the stable-view index, while a
filtered, isolated, or projection-replaced identity releases the prior reference and map without
building a replacement index until a connector request needs one.

The app interaction controller caches a source-to-query index per data reference and base
annotation. Each source list is sorted once while that cached index is constructed, by descending
confidence then protein id. A predicted click creates one query-to-source pair. A source click scans
its already ordered list once, counts legend-eligible candidates, and materializes only the first 20
pairs whose endpoints are in the current view; it neither re-sorts nor allocates a full filtered
candidate array. Off-view candidates remain in the total and contribute once to unavailable status,
but do not consume the 20-line visible cap. If the clicked source itself leaves the view, every
legend-eligible semantic connection is unavailable: re-resolution emits no drawable pairs and
reports the full candidate total without allocating those pairs. A predicted-query request likewise
materializes its single pair only while both endpoints are in view.

The interaction controller retains one bounded semantic click descriptor (dataset, annotation,
protein id, and global index) while the core overlay request remains active. Filter and isolation
data changes re-resolve that descriptor through the cached confidence ordering, so view expansion
restores the correct highest-ranked endpoint ids and a constrained view promotes later visible
candidates to keep the drawable cap full. Dataset/annotation/overlay changes, legend invalidation,
selection clearing, and explicit dismissal deactivate the core request; the app observes that state
and discards the semantic descriptor rather than resurrecting dismissed connectors.

Connector endpoints replace `highlightedProteinIds` while active. Empty-space click, annotation or
overlay changes, data replacement, deselection, authoritative category-interactivity changes,
Escape, and an accessible close button clear both lines and connector highlights. Clearing on
legend visibility change prevents a previously valid pair from remaining stale after either its
source or target becomes hidden. Because connector-owned highlighting applies the selected-opacity
tier, the scatter plot revalidates candidate endpoints after installing those highlights; if the
configured selected opacity makes either endpoint non-interactable, that pair is suppressed and an
empty request clears the highlight/status instead of drawing to invisible points. Dashed stroke,
endpoint emphasis, text status, and keyboard dismissal make the feature non-colour-dependent.

Alternative considered: drawing connectors in WebGL was rejected because SVG already owns
interaction overlays and supplies zoom transforms, vector strokes, DOM accessibility, and simpler
deterministic tests.

### D7. Reconstruct v2 storage on bundle export and fingerprint the side-channel

The bundle writer skips synthetic confidence annotations. It serializes every categorical column
with the v2 codec: labels percent-encode structural `%`, `;`, and `|` characters; positional
evidence or numeric-score suffixes are reconstructed; multi-hit values use structural semicolons;
and the annotations parquet footer is stamped `protspace_format_version=2`. Runtime identity remains
attached when a selected numeric confidence view is materialized, so writer omission does not depend
on whether export receives raw or display-materialized data. For each EAT base,
predicted positions are serialized as missing in `BASE`, then the writer reconstructs all three EAT
companion columns from `annotation_predicted`. This remains correct even if the caller passes
display-materialized data. A golden backend-produced v2 fixture write/reload regression compares
per-protein annotation sets, evidence, scores, and every prediction companion.

Slicing copies `annotation_predicted` in protein order. Dataset hashing includes sorted
base/protein/value/confidence/source tuples so bundles with identical curated annotations but
different transfers cannot share persisted settings. Filtering/isolation retains global lookup
correctness and display-local connector visibility.

Hashing computes one protein-id-sorted index permutation and reuses it for every raw numeric and EAT
prediction track. Tracks stream values and cells through that order rather than allocating and
sorting one object per protein per track, keeping synchronous load-path auxiliary memory bounded at
the 500,000 to 1,000,000-point target.

### D8. Validate in vertical slices and with the real bundle

Tests cover companion recognition and invalid data, optimized and small conversion paths, synthetic
confidence, slicing/hash/export/settings, visibility precedence and threshold boundaries, WebGL
attribute/staging/shader behavior, tooltip and legend output, connector geometry and fan-out, and
control accessibility. The exact 832-protein phosphatase asset linked from issue #277 comment
4902936797 is the checked-in browser fixture: its source ZIP SHA-256 is
`b302a3c81f898c789f201ed0bc3c614ebd24c01db237f749f0a983ccd9954080`, and the contained/check-in
bundle SHA-256 is `06bacd7a1f862bdea4a9bf2e81037a4a7d772636704c74e3f2806958f3b9ba33`.
The browser flow verifies the accessible supported controls, transfer counts and hollow staging,
toggle/threshold behavior, tooltip provenance, both connector directions, projection recomputation,
dismissal, responsive layout, and encoded PNG/export. Full precommit and relevant E2E tests run
before every commit.

### D9. Integrate owner follow-up without duplicating application state

Place the EAT fieldset after annotation selection and render it only for the selected base whose
prediction channel contains usable cells. Pass the available EAT base names into the existing
annotation selector and mark those rows with a text-labelled badge; generated confidence views stay
unmarked. Pair the native threshold range with a bounded integer percentage input. Both controls
normalize through one handler and continue to emit the existing `eat-overlay-change` contract, so
settings persistence and scatter invalidation remain single-sourced.

True reliability filtering remains in the existing query builder through the generated numeric
`<base> — EAT confidence` annotation. The range continues to implement the original fade threshold;
adding a second direct-filter toggle was rejected because it would create competing filter ownership,
query composition, reset, and persistence semantics.

Preserve decoded EAT value labels as an ordered runtime list alongside the canonical joined storage
value, with score and evidence arrays aligned to those labels. Overlay materialization, tooltip
display, category unioning, hashing, and v2 companion export consume the structured hits, while
legacy manually constructed cells fall back to their single `value`. This keeps literal semicolons
distinguishable from structural separators and routes multi-valued predictions through the existing
multi-label texture path. Increase the normalized
signed-distance ring width so the hollow stroke is visibly legible and responds to the configured
point diameter in the shared live/export shader. D10 supersedes the original linear-proportionality
rule with bounded thickness after exact-fixture inspection showed that it consumed small interiors.

The existing connector endpoint circles remain inside the transformed SVG overlay group. Their
geometry therefore follows pan/zoom and their stroke remains non-scaling, as required by the
connector spec; rendered measurement is used to validate that behavior before changing it.

Provenance receives the click detail's global `originalIndex` directly. The resolver retains only
its annotation-scoped reverse source index and evaluates legend eligibility separately from
filtered/isolation membership. Off-view eligible candidates retain their identity through the
bounded semantic click descriptor; the resolver counts each unavailable candidate once and
reconstructs the drawable request if the view later expands, while legend-hidden candidates are
excluded. Source indices computed during normalization make the predicted-to-source path O(1)
without a million-entry dataset-wide id map.

EAT-capable annotation keys are derived from the authoritative loaded scatter-plot dataset, not a
filtered or isolated `data-change` slice. Counts, visibility, and rendering continue to consume the
slice; capability markers and controls remain stable while a constrained view temporarily contains
no predicted rows.

Transfer is also a v1/v2 migration boundary. The Python CLI detects legacy annotation metadata,
selects transfer labels under v1 semantics, then parenthesis-aware parses and v2-encodes every
categorical cell before the replacement table receives its v2 stamp. V2 inputs bypass migration.
Opaque `__pred_source` identifiers use the shared field encoder at production and are decoded as one
field by the web loader, so literal `%`, `;`, and `|` never become categorical structure.

### D10. Refine EAT semantics and screen-space legibility after exact-fixture inspection

Exact-fixture inspection exposed four presentation ambiguities without changing the underlying data
contract. First, long structured transfer labels are lossless in the view model but the tooltip's
single-line ellipsis hides biologically meaningful EC descriptions. Transferred annotation labels
therefore wrap to complete text while score/evidence columns remain compact. Runtime tooltip-height
measurement stays authoritative; the pure fallback estimator accounts conservatively for wrapped
rows so initial placement does not run below the viewport.

Second, the enlarged predicted outline from D9 can consume most of a small point sprite because its
derivative-scaled width has no upper bound. The shared live/export shader will retain the same marker
diameter and category colour, but clamp the normalized ring width so an anti-aliased interior hole
always remains. Enlarging predicted points independently was rejected because point size is an
existing visual encoding and changing it would distort comparison with observed proteins.
The interior uses the resolved plot-surface colour as an opaque knockout rather than transparency:
exact-fixture dense clusters demonstrated that transparent holes reveal previously painted markers
and therefore look filled. Live rendering resolves the host background; opaque exports resolve the
requested background. A transparent export retains the live surface colour only inside transferred
markers while pixels outside markers remain transparent—an intentional marker-style island required
to preserve the non-colour transfer cue. Mixing the knockout in premultiplied space keeps its
boundary anti-aliased even when the prediction ring is reliability-faded.
Because a later coincident observed point could otherwise cover the knockout, the canonical
live/export painter depth uses four stable tiers: unselected observed, unselected transferred,
selected observed, selected transferred. Existing opacity/category depth remains the within-tier
ordering, and the selected tiers stay contiguous for the renderer's established two-pass blend.

Third, provenance endpoint halos communicate exactly which two points terminate a dashed connector,
which remains valuable in a dense cloud and provides a cue beyond connector colour. Their current
radius inherits the parent zoom transform, however, and becomes visually dominant. Endpoint
positions and connector lines will continue to use the transformed data-space group, while circle
radii are inversely scaled from the current zoom factor so the halo diameter remains constant in
screen space. This preserves localization without obscuring neighboring proteins.

Finally, the threshold is an emphasis control rather than a filter: transfers below it remain
visible and interactive. The fieldset stays immediately after the active Annotation selector, where
its dependency is clear, but its visible and accessible copy changes from “Minimum reliability” to
“Emphasize reliability ≥”. Supporting text states that lower-reliability transfers are dimmed, not
removed, and points users to the generated numeric confidence annotation when removal is required.
The range and synchronized integer percentage input remain together: the range supports rapid
visual exploration while the number supports exact, reproducible values. Hiding either input in a
popover was rejected because it reduces discoverability and makes a scientifically relevant display
setting harder to inspect.

The population key reports two classes, observed and transferred, rather than three. A protein whose
only value is the NA category is neither observed nor transferred, but it is already represented by
the dataset's existing N/A legend entry, so a third “No annotation” row would only duplicate that
count under a different label.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **Additional per-protein arrays increase memory for EAT bundles** → Allocate channels only for
  detected base columns, materialize only the selected base column, and cache by stable references.
- **Invalid companion data could disappear silently** → Enforce one validity rule, warn once with
  counts, and test incomplete/out-of-range cases.
- **Overlay or numeric materialization could contaminate export** → Reconstruct curated bases and
  companions from `annotation_predicted`, preserve runtime annotation identity through derived
  numeric bins, and test export from raw, overlay-materialized, and selected-confidence views.
- **A popular source could create DOM or visual overload** → Pre-order each cached source list once,
  retain only a bounded semantic click descriptor, rescan without a full candidate allocation when
  view membership changes, and cap deterministically at 20 highest-confidence currently drawable
  links with an explicit N-of-M status.
- **Hollow glyphs can become illegible at small point sizes** → Use the shader's derivative-based
  signed-distance anti-aliasing, retain a minimum ring width, and assert live/export shader parity.
- **Confidence could be misread as calibrated probability** → Use “reliability index” language and
  percentage formatting only as a bounded display representation.
- **Existing selection/highlight behavior could conflict with connectors** → Connector highlights
  use the currently unused highlight channel, never mutate selection, are cleared independently,
  and are followed by an authoritative endpoint-validity check.

## Migration Plan

The change is additive across the transfer producer and frontend consumer. Old bundles load with no
EAT controls or altered render. New EAT fields in settings are optional, so older settings normalize
to defaults. The transfer command migrates legacy v1 categorical cells before stamping v2 metadata;
existing bundles remain unchanged on disk. Deploy can be rolled back because the migrated output
retains the same annotation columns and three EAT companions. The OpenSpec change is archived only
after the PR is green and review feedback is resolved.

## Open Questions

None. Product and numerical defaults are fixed above; implementation findings that invalidate an
assumption require updating this design before continuing.

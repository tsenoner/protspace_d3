'@protspace/core': patch
---

Integrated Storybook into `@protspace/core` for UI component development, testing, and demonstration.
This allows for viewing and interacting with components, such as the scatterplot, in an isolated environment.

- An initial Storybook example for the Scatterplot component has been added (`packages/core/src/components/scatterplot/scatterplot.stories.ts`).
- To run Storybook for the core package, use the command: `pnpm --filter @protspace/core storybook`.

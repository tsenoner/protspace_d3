"""Classify proteins as transfer queries vs annotated references.

Rules match by ID prefix and/or a case-insensitive metadata substring
(``column ~ substring``). No biology is hardcoded; an *explicit* rule that
matches nothing is an error, on either side.

A rule with no clauses is **open** — it restricts nothing and matches every
protein. Passing no rules at all therefore means "transfer within this
dataset": every protein is a candidate on both sides, and the caller splits
them per column into the ones missing a value (queries) and the ones holding
one (references).

    the other set — which is what lets both sets cover the whole table when no

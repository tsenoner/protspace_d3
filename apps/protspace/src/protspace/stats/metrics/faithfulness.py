"""Projection-faithfulness statistics vs. the source embedding.

Two families (tagged by ``scope`` in each row's ``extra``):
  local  — kNN-neighbourhood preservation: ``knn_overlap``, ``trustworthiness``,
           ``continuity`` (do nearby points stay nearby?).
  global — whole-layout preservation: ``random_triplet`` (relative-ordering
           accuracy over random triplets) and ``spearman_distance`` (rank
           correlation of all pairwise distances) — the mid/long-range structure
           the local metrics miss.

These compare a projection to its *source embedding*. The high-dimensional
distance metric (the reducer's own metric, euclidean by default unless the
projection was built with e.g. cosine) defines the embedding-space neighbourhoods
for all three statistics, so trustworthiness and continuity form a consistent
dual pair — both define the embedding's neighbourhoods by ``high_dim_metric`` and
the coords' by euclidean (differing only in which space supplies ranks vs sets):

  trustworthiness = penalises false neighbours (near in coords, far in embedding)
  continuity      = penalises missed neighbours (near in embedding, far in coords)

``sklearn.manifold.trustworthiness`` only applies its ``metric`` argument to the
first (ranked) input, so continuity with a non-euclidean high-dim metric is not
expressible via a single call; ``_continuity`` computes it with the same
normalisation as sklearn (and is bit-identical when the metric is euclidean).

Both build a full pairwise distance matrix (no ANN path), so above a sample
threshold a fixed-seed shared subsample is used, and beyond a hard ceiling the
statistic is skipped with a recorded marker.

scikit-learn imports are function-local to keep CLI startup fast.

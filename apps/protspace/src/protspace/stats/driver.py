"""Driver: build per-projection contexts, map to embeddings, run statistics.

For each reduction (projection) it selects the *source* embedding, id-joins the
embedding rows to the projection coordinates, reads the high-dim distance metric
from the reducer params, and runs every registered statistic — isolating
per-statistic failures so a partial/empty report never raises.

    Directional on purpose. A FASTA covering MORE than the embeddings is routine

    it was built from -- and the extra entries are simply unused downstream.

    The other direction is damaging. ``compute_similarity`` zero-fills the row
    for a protein it cannot find, leaving that protein's self-similarity at 0,
    and the similarity-to-distance conversion only fires when the WHOLE diagonal
    is 1. One uncovered protein therefore suppresses the conversion for every
    pair and inverts the entire MDS projection -- so under ``--similarity`` this
    is an error, not a warning.

    Both sides go through ``parse_identifier``: ``load_h5`` keeps raw HDF5 keys
    while FASTA-derived identifiers are always parsed, so comparing them raw
    would report every protein uncovered for a ``sp|...``-keyed file.

"""Generate the canonical .parquetbundle files for the cross-language contract test.

The producer (``apps/protspace``, Python) and the consumer (``packages/core``
data-loader, TypeScript) live in one repo but are tested only against
themselves. This script is the producer half of the seam: it emits every bundle
layout the producer can write, and ``bundle.contract.test.ts`` reads them back
with the real web reader.

Bundles are always generated into a caller-supplied directory, never committed.
A committed fixture cannot fail when the writer changes; a generated one can.

The bundles are produced by shelling out to the real ``protspace bundle`` CLI
rather than by calling ``write_bundle`` directly. Two transformations live only
in the CLI layer and are contract surface the reader depends on:

* the ``identifier`` -> ``protein_id`` column rename, and
* ``stamp_format_version``, which marks the annotations table as v2.

A reader that mishandles either still passes a ``write_bundle``-only generator.

ASSUMPTION THIS FILE ENCODES
----------------------------
The input parquets below stand in for what ``protspace annotate`` and
``protspace project`` would have produced -- their schemas are hand-written here
from the real thing (see ``base_processor._create_projections_*_table`` and the
``annotate`` CLI). If those stages change their output columns, this generator
keeps emitting the old shape and the contract test stays green against a stale
idea of their output. That narrower gap is a documented non-goal of the
``add-bundle-contract-test`` change; the gap being closed is the much wider one
where nothing checked the producer/consumer seam at all.

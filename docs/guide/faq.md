# FAQ

Frequently asked questions about ProtSpace.

## General

### Do I need machine learning knowledge?

No. ProtSpace is designed for biologists and researchers - you only need protein embeddings.

### Is my data uploaded to a server?

It depends on what you import.

- **`.parquetbundle` files stay local.** Loading, exploring, filtering and exporting a bundle all
  run in your browser, the file never leaves your computer.
- **FASTA files are uploaded.** Dropping a `.fasta` / `.fa` / `.fna` file sends your sequences to
  the ProtSpace prep backend, which computes embeddings and projections and returns a
  `.parquetbundle`. If you need your sequences to stay on your machine, prepare the bundle
  yourself with the [Colab notebook](/guide/data-preparation) or the
  [Python CLI](/guide/python-cli), then import the resulting bundle.

Either way, ProtSpace stores your last imported dataset locally in your browser's OPFS storage, and
it stores per-dataset settings locally in browser storage. See
[Data & Settings Persistence](/explore/importing-data#data-settings-persistence) for details.

### Which file formats are supported?

Two:

- **`.parquetbundle`**, the standard ProtSpace format, loaded entirely in your browser. See
  [Data Preparation](/guide/data-preparation) for how to generate one.
- **FASTA (`.fasta`, `.fa`, `.fna`)**, on deployments that run the prep backend, dropping a FASTA
  file uploads it, builds a bundle, and opens it automatically. Sequence counts must be between 20
  and 1500, and the file must be 8 MB or smaller.

See [Importing Data](/explore/importing-data) for the full FASTA workflow.

### Can I use it offline?

Yes, after initial page load. Note: 3D structure loading requires internet.

### Is it free?

Yes. ProtSpace is open source under the MIT license.

## Data

### How do I generate a .parquetbundle?

- [Google Colab notebook](/guide/data-preparation) - No installation (recommended)
- [Python CLI](/guide/python-cli) - For local processing or automation

### What is the recommended dataset size?

| Size           | Performance                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| < 10K proteins | Optimal - smooth experience       |
| 10K - 500K     | Good - may slow on older devices  |
| > 500K         | Challenging - consider subsetting |

Browser performance varies by device and GPU capabilities.

### Can I add custom annotations?

Yes. Add columns when generating the bundle. See [Data Format](/guide/data-format).

### How do I include 3D structures?

Structures load automatically from AlphaFold if your protein IDs are UniProt accessions.

### Why can't ProtSpace save my dataset for automatic reloads?

ProtSpace uses the Origin Private File System (OPFS) to remember the last dataset you imported across page reloads. If automatic reload is unavailable, the most common reasons are:

- You are using private/incognito browsing mode
- Browser storage is restricted by browser settings or extensions
- Your browser does not support OPFS

Your dataset still loads and works normally for the current session. You only need to import it again after reloading the page. For the best experience, use a recent browser in a normal non-private window.

## Visualization

### Can I customize colors?

Yes! Click the **cog icon** (⚙️) in the legend panel to access settings. You can select from multiple **color palettes** (including colorblind-safe options), and your color choices persist per category across sessions.

### What are multi-label annotations?

Annotations with multiple values per protein (e.g., multiple EC numbers). Displayed as pie charts.

## Performance

### The browser is slow or freezing

1. Use Chrome for best performance
2. Reduce dataset size

### Which browser works best?

| Browser | Performance |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Chrome  | Best        |
| Brave   | Best        |
| Edge    | Excellent   |
| Safari  | Good        |
| Firefox | Slower      |

### Can I visualize 1 million proteins?

Not recommended. Performance degrades above 500K proteins - consider subsetting.

## Technical

### What are the system requirements?

**Browser**: Modern browser with WebGL 2.0 support

- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13.1+
- Edge 80+

**Hardware**: Any modern computer. Better GPU = better performance.

### What's inside a .parquetbundle?

Three to five Parquet tables bundled together:

1. Annotation data (protein metadata)
2. Projection metadata (methods, parameters)
3. Projection coordinates (x, y, z)
4. Settings (optional, legend colors, shapes, export options)
5. Statistics (optional, projection quality metrics from `protspace stats`)

The optional settings table is included when you export with "Include legend/export settings" enabled. See [Data Format](/guide/data-format) for details.

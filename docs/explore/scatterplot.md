# Navigating the Scatterplot

The scatterplot is the main visualization area where proteins appear as points. Learn how to navigate, select, and explore your data.

## Navigation

![Zooming and panning](./images/zoom.gif)

- **Zoom**: Scroll wheel or pinch gesture
- **Pan**: Click and drag on the background
- **Reset**: Double-click the scatterplot to fit all proteins

## Selection

### Single & Multi-Select

![Single selection](./images/select-single.gif)

- **Click** a point to select it
- **⌘ + click** (Mac) or **Ctrl + click** (Windows) to add to selection
- Click the same point again to deselect it

### Box Selection

![Box selection](./images/select-box.gif)

1. Click the **Select** button in the control bar
2. Drag to draw a rectangle
3. All proteins inside are selected

### Lasso Selection

1. Click **Select** to enter selection mode
2. Click the **lasso** icon in the tool picker that appears
3. Click and drag to draw a freeform outline around proteins
4. Release to select all enclosed proteins

The lasso requires at least 3 points to form a valid selection area. Switch back to the **rectangle** icon at any time.

::: tip Additive Mode
When the **Select** button is active, all selections (clicks, box drags, and lasso draws) are additive. Without it, each new selection replaces the previous one.

### Clearing

- Press **Escape** to clear selections (first press), then exit selection mode (second press)
- Click the **Clear** button

## Understanding the Display

### Point Position

Points close together have similar embeddings - often indicating similar structure, function, or evolutionary history.

### Point Colors

- **Categorical** (reviewed, protein family, species): Unique color per category
- **Multi-label** (EC numbers, domains): Pie charts showing multiple values

### Protein Tooltip

Hover over a point to see a tooltip with details about that protein:

- **Protein ID** and **UniProtKB ID** (if available)
- **Protein name** and **Gene name** (if available)
- **Annotation values** for the currently selected annotation
- **Scores** (for InterPro domain annotations, e.g., E-values) or **evidence codes** (for GO terms, subcellular location, etc., e.g., EXP, IDA)

Protein name, gene name, and UniProtKB ID are tooltip-only and don't appear in the [Annotation dropdown](/explore/control-bar#_2-annotation-selector).

### Duplicate Points

When multiple proteins share the exact same coordinates, a **count badge** appears on the point (when enabled in the legend settings). Click a stacked point to expand it into a spider layout showing each individual protein.

### Projection Metadata

A small bar-chart icon sits in the **top-left corner** of the scatterplot. Hover it (or focus it with
the keyboard) to open a **Projection Metadata** panel describing the current projection. Click the
icon to pin the panel open, so you can scroll it and read the ⓘ popovers inside without keeping the
pointer on the card. **Escape** or a click outside closes it; switching projections updates it.

::: tip
The icon only appears when the loaded bundle has something to show: reduction parameters,
faithfulness metrics, or statistics for the annotation you are colouring by, either its separation
in this projection or, for a clustering, its Recovers table. Any one is enough, so a bundle prepared
with `--stats` but no projection metadata still gets a panel, and a clustering found in another
projection gets one on Recovers alone. A bundle carrying none of them shows no icon at all.
:::

The card's header is the projection's own name. Below it, in order:

- **Separation, scored on `<annotation>`**, how cleanly the current annotation's categories separate
  in this projection, with the source embedding's own scores beside them as a ceiling. Documented on
  [Separation Scores](/explore/separation-scores).
- **Recovers**, only when the current annotation is a `cluster_elbow_*` / `cluster_silhouette_*`
  clustering: how closely that clustering reproduces each real annotation. Documented under
  [Cluster Annotations](/explore/separation-scores#cluster-annotations).
- **Faithfulness to the embedding**, described below.
- **How it was made**, described below.

#### Faithfulness to the embedding

How well the 2D or 3D layout preserves the structure of the original high-dimensional embedding, as
one labelled row per metric under two group headings. Every row carries its value and its own ⓘ
popover.

**Local — are the same proteins still neighbours?**

- **kNN Overlap**, fraction of each point's k nearest neighbors preserved in the projection
- **Trustworthiness**, penalizes points pulled together in the projection that were far apart
- **Continuity**, penalizes points pushed apart in the projection that were close together

**Global — is the overall layout preserved?**

- **Random Triplet**, fraction of random point triplets whose relative ordering survives
- **Spearman Distance**, rank correlation between high-dimensional and projected pairwise distances

The neighborhood size `k`, the high-dimensional distance metric, and the source embedding are the
same for every metric, so no row repeats them: one scope line covers all of them, such as
`811 proteins compared`, gaining `· subsampled` when the comparison ran on a subsample. These
metrics travel in the projection metadata (`info_json.quality`), not in the statistics part, so they
appear whether or not the bundle was built with `--stats`.

#### How it was made

The parameters the dimensionality-reduction method was run with, read from the bundle's projection
metadata table. **Source** names the embedding the projection was computed from, which is useful
when a bundle contains projections from several embeddings. The rest depend on the method:

- **PCA**, `N Components`, plus `Explained Variance Ratio` (one value per component)
- **UMAP**, `N Neighbors`, `Min Dist`, `Metric`, `Random State`, and the rest of the UMAP
  parameter set

Two things are deliberately absent from the list: the dimension count, which you already pick in the
[Projection selector](/explore/control-bar), and the projection's name, which is the card header
rather than a row.

#### Across the whole card

Values anywhere on the card are formatted for readability: whole numbers print as-is, other numbers
are rounded to three decimals (two for explained-variance values), booleans show as **Yes**/**No**,
lists are comma-separated, and a value that is missing or could not be computed shows as `N/A`.

Whenever the card carries any scores at all, separation or faithfulness, it ends with a footer
reading `All scores are for the full dataset.`, becoming
`All scores are for the full dataset, not this view.` while a filter or isolation narrows the plot,
for the reason on [Separation Scores](/explore/separation-scores#scores-cover-the-whole-dataset).

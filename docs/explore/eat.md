# Transferred Annotations (EAT)

Most annotation columns have holes in them. A protein that nobody has characterised has no EC number, no family, no GO term, and colouring by that column leaves it in the `N/A` bucket where it says nothing at all.

Embedding Annotation Transfer (EAT) fills those holes by borrowing. For every protein missing a value, it finds the nearest annotated protein in the original high-dimensional embedding space (not in the 2D layout you are looking at) and copies that protein's label across, along with a reliability index in [0, 1] and the identifier of the protein it came from.

The borrowed values never overwrite anything. They live in their own columns, so a transferred value and a curated value are two different facts about a protein and the interface keeps them visibly apart. A bundle that carries predictions shows them by default, with nothing hidden by reliability, so your first view already includes every borrowed value.

::: info Predictions are made before you open the dataset
Transfer runs in the Python CLI, not in the browser: `protspace transfer` writes the prediction columns into a bundle. Nothing on this page creates predictions, it only shows the ones a bundle already carries. See [`protspace transfer`](/guide/python-cli#protspace-transfer) for the command and its options.

## The Three Columns

For a curated column `COL`, transfer adds three companions and leaves `COL` itself untouched:

| Column                 | Holds                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `COL__pred_value`      | The borrowed label.                                                              |
| `COL__pred_confidence` | The reliability index, 0 to 1. The interface also calls this the EAT confidence. |
| `COL__pred_source`     | The identifier of the reference protein the label came from.                     |

A protein that already had a curated value gets no prediction at all, so the three columns are populated only where `COL` was empty.

## Finding Them

Annotations carrying predictions are marked with an **EAT** badge in the [Annotation dropdown](/explore/control-bar#_2-annotation-selector), beside the annotation's name. The badge appears only for columns that have at least one transferred value, so it doubles as the list of what is worth exploring. If no annotation carries the badge, the bundle has no predictions in it.

This is not the ⚡ **Predicted** badge, which marks a whole column as computational based on its name. An **EAT** badge means the opposite: the column is curated, and only some of its cells were filled in. See [Predicted Annotations](/explore/legend#predicted-annotations).

Select a badged annotation and the legend grows an extra section at the top.

## The Legend Section

At the top of the [legend panel](/explore/legend), above the separation strips and the category list, a block titled **Predicted (transferred)** appears whenever the annotation you are colouring by has predictions. It holds three things.

**Show** turns the overlay on and off. It is on by default. With it on, every transferred protein is coloured by its borrowed value and joins that value's legend row, so the row counts and the plot both reflect the filled-in column. Turn it off and those proteins fall straight back to their curated cell, which is empty, so they return to `N/A`. The curated data is never modified, so toggling is cheap and lossless.

**Hide below reliability** is a slider with a matching `%` number input beside it. Both drive the same threshold and are disabled while Show is off. See [Filtering By Reliability](#filtering-by-reliability) below.

**The counts** sit underneath, and only while Show is on: **Observed** against **Predicted by EAT**. Each carries a swatch encoding the distinction the plot uses, filled for observed and hollow for predicted. The swatches are always drawn as circles; in the plot each marker keeps its own category's shape and colour. Proteins that have neither a curated value nor a prediction are in neither count.

## Telling Them Apart In The Plot

A transferred protein is drawn as a **hollow ringed marker**: its shape and its colour are exactly those of the value it borrowed, but the interior is punched out, leaving a ring. Curated proteins stay solid.

This means the two populations read as one distribution at a glance, since the colours match, while any individual point still declares which kind it is. The ring thickness scales with the marker, so it stays legible at any **Shape size** rather than closing the hole on small markers or hair-lining on large ones.

Hover a transferred protein and its tooltip carries a **Predicted (transferred)** block for the active annotation: the reliability as a percentage, a bar showing the same number, and the line `Reliability index · source <ID>` naming the reference protein the label was copied from.

Three things are worth knowing about when the rings appear:

- Only for the annotation you are currently colouring by. A protein can carry transfers for several columns; only the active one is drawn.
- Only while **Show** is on.
- In exported images too. The live renderer and the [export](/explore/exporting) renderer share one shader, so a PNG or the [Figure Editor](/explore/figure-editor) output keeps the same solid/hollow distinction.

::: warning A ringed marker is a guess
Hollow means "no curated value existed and this is the nearest neighbour's label". It is an inference from embedding geometry, not evidence. Read a hollow cluster as a hypothesis about that region of the map.

## Where A Prediction Came From

Provenance is also drawable. With the overlay on, clicking a point in the plot traces the transfer as dashed lines, in whichever direction makes sense for the point you clicked:

- **Click a transferred protein** and one dashed line joins it to its source, the protein whose label it borrowed for the currently active annotation.
- **Click a source protein** and dashed lines fan out to every protein that borrowed from it.

A protein that is both a transferred protein and a source for others takes the first case: only its own source line is drawn. If that source's legend category is hidden, the click draws nothing at all.

Endpoints get an unfilled halo so you can find the termini without the emphasis covering the markers underneath. Clicking still selects the protein exactly as it always did: the connectors are drawn on top of normal selection, not instead of it.

A heavily reused source can have hundreds of dependants, so the fan-out is capped at **20 lines**, taking the highest-confidence targets first with the protein identifier as a deterministic tie-break. Candidates whose legend category is hidden are excluded outright. Candidates that exist but are currently off-view, removed by a filter or by [isolation](/explore/control-bar#_6-isolate-button), are reported instead of drawn: a small status strip appears at the bottom of the plot reading `3 hidden (off-view)` with a × to dismiss it. It shows only when something is actually missing, so a fully drawable click is silent.

Connectors are transient state and clear on Escape, on the status strip's close button, on clicking empty plot space, on clearing the selection, on changing the annotation, on toggling a legend category's visibility, on turning **Show** off, and on loading new data.

They do survive everything that only changes the view. Connectors hold protein identifiers rather than coordinates, so switching projection (`ProtT5 — PCA 2` to `ProtT5 — UMAP 2`, say), flipping a 3D plane, panning, zooming, filtering, or isolating re-resolves both endpoints against the new layout rather than dropping the lines. An endpoint that a filter removed comes back as a line when the filter is cleared, without a second click.

## Reading The Reliability Number

The reliability index is a transform of the distance to the reference protein: closer neighbour, higher number. Its exact form depends on the `--metric` and `--k` used at transfer time, and the [reliability index](/guide/python-cli#reliability-index) section gives the formulas.

::: warning Rank, not probability
With the default `cosine` metric the reliability index is a bounded cosine similarity; with `--metric euclidean` it is the goPredSim transform, which was calibrated on ProtT5. On other embedding spaces, whose raw distances can be on a very different scale, treat it as a way of ranking predictions against each other rather than as a probability that the label is correct. A 0.9 is more trustworthy than a 0.6 in the same dataset, but it is not a 90% chance of being right. Values produced with different `--k` settings are not comparable at all.
:::

## Filtering By Reliability

**Hide below reliability** hides predictions whose confidence falls below the threshold. It starts at 0, meaning nothing is hidden, and the slider and the `%` box are two views of the same number.

Curated values are never affected. The threshold applies only to transferred cells, so raising it leaves the observed data whole. This is a different outcome from turning **Show** off: **Show** returns transferred proteins to `N/A`, while the threshold removes them from the view the way any other filter condition does.

The slider is a front end for an ordinary filter. Dragging it above 0 writes a single condition into the [filter query](/explore/control-bar#_7-filter-button), `NOT(<annotation> — EAT confidence < x)`, on a numeric column the app synthesises at load time for each transferred annotation. The mirror runs both ways: edit or delete that condition in the filter builder and the slider follows. Each transferred annotation gets its own condition, so tuning one does not disturb another, and your unrelated filter conditions are left alone.

::: tip The EAT confidence column is filter-only
`<annotation> — EAT confidence` is not offered in the Annotation dropdown, because colouring by it would say nothing about the proteins that were never predicted. It exists in the filter column picker, where a raw confidence threshold is what you actually want. It is synthesised on load and is not written back into exported bundles.
:::

Because this is a real filter, it interacts with everything else that responds to a filtered view. In particular the [separation score](/explore/separation-scores) strips hide themselves while any filter is active, the reliability slider included, since whole-dataset scores would contradict a narrowed view.

Exporting a bundle with settings included stores the **Show** state and the threshold, so a shared dataset reopens on the same view.

## Trying It

A prepared demo bundle ships with the repository: `venom_eat_stats.parquetbundle`, 811 venom proteins with two transferred columns, `ec` (384 transferred values) and `protein_families` (14), across the `ProtT5 — PCA 2` and `ProtT5 — UMAP 2` projections.

There is no dataset picker in the app, so download it from the [GitHub data folder](https://github.com/tsenoner/protspace/tree/main/apps/web/public/data) and drag it into the viewer as you would any other bundle. See [Importing Data](/explore/importing-data).

Colour by `ec` to see the effect at its strongest: nearly half the dataset is a ring, and the shape of the ringed region tells you which parts of the embedding EAT was confident enough to reach into.

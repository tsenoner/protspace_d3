# Known Issues

## Bugs
1. **AlphaFold2 Structure Display**
   - The 3D protein structure should be displayed inline below the legend instead of in a separate modal dialog
   - When a user selects a protein through search, the structure should automatically be retrieved and displayed below the legend

2. **Legend Count Inaccuracy**
   - The count of proteins for each category currently always shows "1"
   - This should display the actual count of proteins belonging to that category

3. **Selection Tool Functionality**
   - The select button should implement a "Box Select" feature similar to the one on https://protspace.rostlab.org/

4. **Image Export**
   - PNG and PDF exported images are low quality
   - Add legend to images and/or as a distinct image

## Enhancement Requests
1. **Visualization Canvas Size**
   - The D3 visualization canvas should stretch to fill the entire available screen space

2. **Color Palette**
   - Adjust the color schema throughout the application for better visibility, especially in the central canvas

## Questions
- What was the idea behind "Share Session"? How does it differ from "Save Session"? (Note: Sorry if my specifications where not on point)
